The project will be conducted with Ericsson and selected employees from the Ericsson Lindholmen office. Ericsson has during the last 6 years been undergoing many changes in their way of working that all relate to an agile way of working. In addition to this they have also started developing software through model-driven development (MDD). 
\smallskip



The most notable changes towards agile in the last 6 years are improved unit testing \cite{UNIT:ENGELS:2007}, component testing \cite{COMP:GAO:2000}, cross-functional teams \cite{XFT:GHOBADI:2011}, continuous integration \cite{CI:ABDUL:2012} and One Track development \cite{ONETRACK:HRIBAR:2008}. The goal of the project is to measure how the changes have been received and if there is a difference in how they have been received by MDD teams and manual coding teams.

Our main contact at Ericsson is Jesper Derehag who works as a software developer. He will be able to put us into contact with other developers that will take part in the survey. Our secondary contact is Peter Gimskog who also works as software developer and will be able to supply us with interviewees. Our contacts will also take part in a qualitative interview after the result from the surveys have been analysed. If there is a need for it, we will interview additional developers to clear up inconsistencies in the survey results.
