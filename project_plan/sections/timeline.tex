We plan to structure our project around four stages, namely Collection, Analysis, Writing and Review. 

\subsection{Collection}
The collection phase will consist of two design phases along with quantitative data collecting. Firstly, the questionnaire of our servey will be designed and sent to our contact at Ericsson. Secondly, dependant on the result from our questionnaire, interviews will be designed to provide a qualitative data collection. We have chosen to perform both quantitative and qualitative data collection to verify that results from our questionnaire correctly projects the reality at Ericsson.

\subsection{Analysis}
The results of the questionnaire and interviews will serve as analysis material from which we can triangulate key areas of our report.

\subsection{Writing}
We outline the report to establish a foundation and then divide the sections to the members of the group. Each member writes his section, but we share research material on a common Git repository. The mother document will be a LaTeX document with modular documents, meaning that each member can write his section and later on link it to the mother documents that is already defined with a consistent formatting and style.

\subsection{Review}
We bring our individual parts together and review it as a single document, making sure it is consistent in language and expression. All parts will be revised as a result of feedback and criticism, and then bring it for final review with our main contact at Ericsson, Jesper Derehag.
