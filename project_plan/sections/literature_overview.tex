Our main focus with the literature review is to provide a general overview for MDD and Agile/Lean. We then intend to research further into the specifics of both areas, highlighting how they correspond or how they diverge from one another.

Figure 2 on page 3 shows an overview of the main research areas that we shall be focusing upon. An initial list of literature is available in the appendix item 1.
