The work will be divided into different areas, to ensure that the scope of the project will be delivered in time. Each member of the group will have one main responsibility area; either surveys, interviews or literature. This is not absolute, which means that all members will contribute in all stages of the project, but the persons responsible for an area are expected to organise the work for that part of the project. 
\hspace{0pt} \\

We have also divided up the different areas of the literature between the members, to ensure that we focus on them equally. The larger parts of the literature which are model-driven development, and agile development practices are intertwined in the parts divided between the members and thus they will be researched by all members.

The following table outlines which areas have been assigned to which members.
