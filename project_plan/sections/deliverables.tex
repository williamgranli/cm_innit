To ensure that the project will be delivered on time and that we don't fall behind schedule; we have identified a set of deliverables that will serve as milstones during the project. The deliverables include mandatory course deliverables, such as the project plan. It also includes deliverables that we have defined to make sure that we have continuous goals throughout the project.
