Workflow: 

Each group member has their own development branch. Ideally,
a development branch contains changes for a specific section
in the report. 

When a version of a section is "finished", it should be pushed
to master. 

If two persons work on the same section, they can either work
on the same development branch, or they work on their own 
branches, and merge the two branches before *one* commit is 
pushed to master.

Commits related to layout/template/config should be pushed
to master.
