\section{Results Analysis}

Small Introduction, one paragraph, hypothesis, which data was used, how it was analysed.

Demographics, who, how many, where, groupings

Explain what we measured, average, why things were taken out (how we decided that).

State any direct correlations or evidence that supports our hypothesis.

Present the results in a table

\section{Discussion}

Intro to discussion, process then design, why.

FD/OT - MDSD seems to prefer it as it creates less merge conflicts, MC, seem to dislike it, which is weird. Discuss this. Jesper agrees this is weird. Suggest here more study is required, we don't have enough information. They scored it low in ease of implementation, perhaps this is an indicator.

CF - Positive, considered finished and implemented. 

CI - Both positive, same result. Only process which is considered finished. Results seem to show high acceptance of this or liking of it.

CT/UT - MDD has these built into it's paradigm whereas MC does not. Jesper saying that the MDD guys have had way more experience than the others might be a cause. We can mention something here about jespers comment that new people have been brought in with this experience of using unit and component tests who then might clash? with the MC developers. Could also relate to the paper I found here about CT not being enough. Frames of mind for unit testing, CT vs UT. MDD guys might see them as different whereas MC guys see them as being the same thing. We could link this to Gash' frames.

\subsection*{Limitations}

Sample Size
Ordinality of the questions, ref to paper, counter with the fact that we have mean etc

Control over distribution
We had no control over the recipients of the surveys; they were handed out for us via Jesper.

Reference the paper where this was found!!

We had one interview which limits the responses as we have nothing else to compare the answers with.

\subsection*{Recomendations (To Ericsson according to CM)}

*Perhaps include a recomendation for comparing MDSD vs CM
