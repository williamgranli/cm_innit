\subsection{Interview questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item General MDSD questions
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Is there any official/proper word for ``manual coding'' in the context of manual coding vs MDSD?
		\item What ``is'' MDSD? (Programming paradigm, development method, toolchain).
		\item What is the distribution between non-MDSD and MDSD?
		\item On what basis are teams/subsystems selected to change to MDSD?
		\item Why did you change to MDSD?
		\item What have been the struggles with MDSD?
		\item What are the positive sides of MDSD?
		\item Were any other development methods than MDSD considered?
		\item Do you think that CI/OT/CFT/UT/CT was implemented as one ``package''?
		\item Were any of the changes bottom-up?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Change Management theories
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Have the changes in Ericsson had a clear plan? 
		\item Do you perceive that the changes had a clear plan/goal?
		\item What is the largest obstacle for change at Ericsson?
		\item What has been the main driving force for previous changes at Ericsson?
		\item Are the changes targeted towards individuals or teams?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Results Analysis
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item MDSD developers seem to prefer One Track and FT a lot more than manual coders do. Correct or not correct?
		\item Manual coders seem to prefer unit testing a lot more than MDSD developers do. Correct or not correct?
		\item Manual coders seem to prefer Cross-functional Teams slightly more than MDSD developers do. Correct or not correct?
		\item Results related to cross functional teams were the most positive. Correct or not correct?
		\item Component testing was equivalent for both groups while the MDSD group seemed to rate unit testing with a lower score. Correct or not correct?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
