Software development organisations must consider an important aspect before introducing  process or design changes: are these changes applicable to our development paradigm?. We explore the implications of this potential oversight, conducting a case study at a department of Ericsson which practises manual coding and Model-driven Software Development (MDSD). Ericsson is just one of a multitude of companies who have implemented changes to their software processes, due to the result of either bottom-up or external pressure. Our report will focus on Ericssonâ€™s implementation of change at the EPG department, and more specifically in relation to how suitable the changes are to their existing development paradigms. This paper will combine a literature review of the changes that have been implemented, how the changes were implemented in relation to common change management theories and techniques, supplemented by both a quantitative and qualitative study. We found that, with certain exceptions, the changes were positively received by the participants involved in our case study.
