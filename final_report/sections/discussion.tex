\section{Discussion}

In this section, we will discuss the findings of our survey, and attempt to answer our research questions. We will conclude this section with a discussion of our research limitations and our recommendations to Ericsson from the perspective of change management. We have distinguished between process and design related activities at Ericsson. This is done so we can discuss the related activities together in logical groupings.

\subsection{Process}

OT was received more positively by MDSD rather than manual coding practitioners, according to the results of our survey. The overall response of MDSD participants was positive (average 4.1), whereas manual coding responses indicated a less than satisfactory result (average 2.9). We may assume that due to the complexity of MDSD merge conflicts, OT was received more positively by the MDSD respondents. However, the underlying cause for the disparity in the results between the MDSD and manual coding groups may be the ease of implementation, which was scored with an average of 2.2 by manual coding practitioners, compared to an average of 4.5 by the MDSD practitioners. We encourage further research in this area, in order to detect the implementation difficulties in OT for manual coding.
\\

CFT, a change that is considered ``finished'', integrated into the culture and successful at EPG, has been given the highest average score by all the survey participants. Our survey results show a slight preference of CFT on behalf of manual coding over MDSD practitioners. However, our data set has not provided us with any further insight into possible difficulties with CFT in MDSD. 
\\

CI is another process change that has been well received by both MDSD and manual coding groups. Similar to OT, CI was introduced to reduce round-trip-time. We can assume, based on our results that CI has resolved this issue for both groups. As a basis for future research, it is noteworthy to mention the implications of the high change rate introduced by CI. It is possible that at some point, the high change rate will become unmanageable, because of the many changes that are introduced within a short time-frame.
\\

The aforementioned process activities seem applicable to both MDSD and manual coding practices at EPG. With the exception of the ease of implementation of OT for the manual coding practitioners, the overall response from both participating groups in the survey indicates, in most cases, a positive response to the change, and in fewer cases a neutral response.

\subsection{Design}

CT and UT have been a staple of the design process at Ericsson for quite some time. Given this, we expected there to be an overall trend of positivity towards both in the organisation. On average however, the results showed that the response was, in fact, rather different. The MDSD developers were a little more negative, averaging total scores of 2.6 for UT and 3.4 for CT. Manual coding developers had a more favorable opinion scoring 3.6 and 3.7 respectively. We found this surprising as we expected the manual coders to score higher than the MDSD developers. Our opinion was that modelling tests, specifically unit tests, would be harder to do than writing them manually in code. This was mainly because we felt that the existence of large, tried and tested frameworks would hopefully ease the implementation of tests. Further interesting results were the large disparity in regard to ease of implementation. The MDSD groups rated the ease of implementation at 1.7 and 2.5, which was far lower than their manual coding counterparts, who gave them a 3.5 and 3.3 respectively.
\\

It is worth noting that we have no experience with testing in a MDSD environment, and as such we had no opinions to draw upon. This was also evident in research, as we were able to find the existence of frameworks and suggestions, but there was nothing which gave us an indication that it was any easier, or harder than manual UT.
\\

Our interviewee had a different opinion compared to what we found in the survey results. The interviewee thought that the MDSD teams would actually hold the testing in higher regard than the manual coders (J. Derehag, personal communication, November 19, 2014). The reason stated was that, \textit{``when MDSD was first introduced many new people came onto the teams who had specific knowledge and expertise with using MDSD''} (J. Derehag, personal communication, November 19, 2014). These experts would have been well versed in the art of creating tests for use in MDSD as they have always had to perform them, and in turn would have no real reason to dislike them. The interviewee further expressed that the MDSD developers have had much more experience in writing unit tests than the manual coders. Specifically, on the \textit{``Manual side, they typically and historically speaking have had neither unit or component testing''} (J. Derehag, personal communication, November 19, 2014). The interviewee also expressed an opinion that the MDSD developers probably prefer CT rather than UT. Interestingly the interviewee mentioned that the MDSD teams are currently moving away from UT and stated that this could be a reason for their apparent dislike of it.
\\

During the interview process at Ericsson, it became clear that the manual coders do not see a distinction between the two types of
testing that are currently performed. This was reinforced by the interviewee who mentioned that \textit{``From a knowledge point of view, they don't equate the two''} (J. Derehag, personal communication, November 19, 2014). This could have meant that the MDSD developers possibly could have given UT an \textit{``underserved low score''} because the MDSD teams prefer CT whereas the manual coding developers see no difference between the two. We feel that this could have contributed significantly to the disparity between the groups' answers.
\\

In answer to our main hypothesis, we feel, based on the evidence obtained, that UT and CT are applicable to both of the development processes and that their inclusion in the design and development process has been a successful change. The main reason we can make this assumption is primarily because both teams rated the performance, quality and the personal fulfilment that they gained, to be between 3.0 and 5.0. This means that the changes either had no effect or only positive effects on the employees. In order to confirm this further, a much deeper and broader study would be required to fully determine if the change has been successful.

\subsection{Limitations}

Our largest limitation is the sample size of our target group. The size was further reduced because of usability issues highlighted previously. These limitations mean that any generalisations or assumptions made need to be reinforced with larger, more in-depth studies. Another limitation is the fact that we only focus on a small subset of Ericsson itself. While suitable for this study, focusing solely on the EPG department is not a strong basis to make claims about the whole of Ericsson.
\\

The questionnaires are another source of limitation. The single largest limitation is that we did not decide the distribution of the questionnaires ourselves; our contact at Ericsson distributed them for us. This caused a limitation as we cannot say with any certainty how the questionnaires were distributed and as such we cannot use that information to help us draw any conclusions. Another limiting factor is the questions in the questionnaire. In hindsight, the questions could have been more precise and could have probed deeper in certain areas. One interesting point that we found in literature was Kitchenham et al. \cite{kitchenham2003principles} arguing against the types of ordinal scales that we used, especially when converting the questions into numerical data to be used for comparison. Kitchenham et al. suggest that by doing this, there is a risk that the results can lose information \cite{kitchenham2003principles}.
\\

Having only one interview was another of the limitations facing our study. Had we the opportunity for more, it might have been possible to draw upon more interesting conclusions from both our results and the interviews. As it stands now we only have the opinion and answers from a single member of the EPG organisation. In order to make more accurate assumptions and find reasonable conclusions we would need to perform further interviews with a larger spread of developers.

\subsection{Recomendations}

While the overall responses were positive from both sets of practitioners, we do have some recommendations which EPG, or even Ericsson, could consider. 
\\

With regard to an overall strategy, we propose that the emergence of bottom-up change should be more critically considered by top management. Since CI and OT have proved to be successful changes, initiated bottom-up, we can assume that the current strategy at EPG resembles the umbrella strategy \cite{mintzberg1985strategies}. These changes, according to our interviewee, faced resistance from management, and were not fully supported from an early point. To extend the boundaries and support bottom-up changes, a possible recommendation would be to pilot the emergent bottom-up initiatives in small projects, in a similar fashion to the deliberate, top-down changes such as CFT, UT and CT. 
\\

We would also recommend more well established metrics, to create standards for measuring the productivity, and therefore the success of the change. Currently, the success of a change is based on the amount of the features that are developed, but this is not indicative of the quality and size of the feature. This leads to potential problems whereby teams could potentially have implemented a change successfully. However, because they are producing large features infrequently, the metrics could show that the changes are unsuccessful. We therefore suggest that the metrics could be revised. A revision of the metrics could provide a more accurate estimation of success. This could help to consolidate changes in process and design activities at Ericsson which, in turn, could help to institutionalise the changes \cite{kotter1995leading}.
\\

Furthermore, we recommend that the vision for change is communicated more clearly. In conjunction to this, we also recommend that EPG continues to pilot the process and design changes, a tactic that has been successful at EPG, in order to form a strong guiding coalition \cite{kotter1995leading}.
