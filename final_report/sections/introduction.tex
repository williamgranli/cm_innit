\section{Introduction}

\subsection{FDD and OT intro}
One Track [ftriauotasld] is a development strategy which is closely related to feature-driven development [adoswa]. Feature-driven development's aim is to deliver software in small tangible units, where the units are features of the system [adoswa]. One Track mainly concerns the development strategy in terms of the version control system, and that the goal is to have only one system version, as opposed to having numerous development branches. 

\subsection{MDSD}
Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) is a programming paradigm which aims to discover abstractions at the domain level and make it possible to implement them with formal modeling [mdsden]. Effectively, the developed models function as abstract and formal simultaneously, serving not only documentation purposes, but are also considered equal to code which can be automatically implemented [mdsden].
